			<p>I graduated with a BS in Clinical Nutrition (2015)</p>
			<p>and after a little bit of soul searching,</p>
			<p> I decided it wasn't for me.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>On Nov 2016, I stumbled across an online CS course</p>
			<p> and never looked back!</p>
			<br/>
			<p>My goal is to keep constantly improve </p>
			<p>and to explore many other aspects of CS!</p>
